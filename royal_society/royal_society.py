At present, the corpus contains articles from the first two centuries of the journal (1665â€•1869) and amounts to around 35 million tokens. The motivation for building the RSC is to investigate the diachronic linguistic development of scientific English. Specifically, we assume that due to specialization, linguistic encodings become more compact over time (Halliday, 1988; Halliday and Martin, 1993), thus creating a specific discourse type characterized by high information density that is functional for expert communication. When building corpora from uncharted material, typically not all relevant meta-data (e.g. author, time, genre) or linguistic data (e.g. sentence/word boundaries, words, parts of speech) is readily available. We present an approach to obtain good quality meta-data and base text data adopting the concept of Agile Software Development.",

_DESCRIPTION = """\
The Royal Society Corpus (RSC) is based on the first two centuries of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London from its beginning in 1665 to 1869. 
It includes all publications of the journal written mainly in English and containing running text. The Philosophical Transactions was the first periodical of scientific 
writing in England. Founded in 1665 by Henry Oldenburg, the first secretary of the Royal Society, it initially contained excerpts of letters of his scientific 
correspondence, reviews and summaries of recently-published books, and accounts of observations and experiments.
